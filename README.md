An Investigation of Conformal Meshing Through Dual Contouring of Hermite Data

This research delves into the intricacies of conformal meshing, focusing on the dual contouring of Hermite data. Surface extraction, integral to computer graphics, scientific visualization, and medical imaging, is explored, emphasizing the challenges and nuances of Hermite data representation. The study evaluates the computational accuracy and efficiency balance, underscoring the need for innovative algorithms. \newline
A literature review traces the evolution of isosurface extraction methods, from the foundational Marching Cubes to advanced techniques like Dual Contouring and Dual Marching Cubes. Each method presents unique strengths: Dual Contouring's prowess in preserving sharp features and Dual Marching Cubes' capability to detail thin structures, albeit computationally intensive.\newline
With the integration of the Intel Embree library for ray tracing and the use of the Eigen C++ library for Quadratic Error Function calculations, this thesis offers a comprehensive view of the practicalities and challenges in conformal meshing, guiding readers in method selection based on application demands. \newline
